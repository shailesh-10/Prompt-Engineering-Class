For example, supervised learning is useful when you have a clear outcome or label for your data, while unsupervised learning is helpful when you want to discover hidden patterns or structures in your data without any pre-existing labels. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is useful in situations where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.\n",

In finance, ML can help with fraud detection, credit scoring, and algorithmic trading. In e-commerce and social media, ML powers recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, and content moderation. In transportation, ML enables autonomous driving, traffic prediction, and demand forecasting.
